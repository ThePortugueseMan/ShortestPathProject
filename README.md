The goal of this project is to find the shortest path between two points, given a matrix describing the map.

Each square in the table above represents a point. Each point has a number associated to it representing the "cost" of crossing it.

The shortest path is the path with least associated "cost".



# Commands
To test the program you must follow the steps:

make - creates the executable program walker.o from walker.c

./walker path1.puz - inputs the given path and outputs a .path file with the shortest path
