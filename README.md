This project outputs the shortest path given a map represented by numbers. The objective is to get the smallest sum going from the inital point to the final one.
The first line gives the parameters of the map such as, number of lines and columns, initial point ...

To test the program you must follow the steps:
make - creates the executable program walker.o from walker.c
./walker path1.puz - inputs the given path and outputs a .path file with the shortest path
